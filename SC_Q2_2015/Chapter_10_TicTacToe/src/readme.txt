    The game will be played by two players on a 3x3 board.

    Two players can play this game. One will play with the symbol X, and the other will use O.

    The winner must have a full row, column, or diagonal of X’s or O’s.

    After each move, the program has to check if there is a winner.

    The winning combination of squares has to be displayed in different colors.

    After the winner is found or there are no empty squares left, the players may select the menu Actions | Play to play again.
