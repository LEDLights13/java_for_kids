The goal of this project is to keep track and display the game score.

- if the ball goes off the table's left border -- +1 point;
- if the ball goes off the table's top or bottom border -- -1 point.
When the method moveTheBall stops playing the timeline,
the ball’s x-coordinate is definitely less than zero so
you need to check the y-coordinate of the ball.


If the y-coordinate of the ball has a value between zero
and the table height, you can assume that the ball crossed the
left border of the table and the Kid scored one point.
Otherwise the ball crossed either top or bottom table’s borders
and the Kid should loose the point.



The Computer scores one point if it bounces the ball
and it crosses the right border of the table.

Don’t forget to implement the Start New Game functionality.
You’ll need to write a method newGame, where you should
reset the scores and place the paddles and the ball
in the starting positions.

Your goal is to display the score in a nice font
on the bottom left corner of the table.
